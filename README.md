# Run RL Swarm (Testnet) Node
RL Swarm is a fully open-source framework developed by GensynAI for building reinforcement learning (RL) training swarms over the internet. This guide walks you through setting up an RL Swarm node and a web UI dashboard to monitor swarm activity.

## Hardware Requirements
- CPU: Minimum 16GB RAM (more RAM recommended for larger models or datasets).

OR

- GPU (Optional): Supported CUDA devices for enhanced performance:
    - RTX 3090
    - RTX 4090
    - A100
    - H100
    > I recommend GPUs with >=24GB vRAM.
-  **Note**: You can run the node without a GPU using CPU-only mode.

## 2) Get HuggingFace Access token
**1- Create account in [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)**

**2- Create an Access Token with `Write` permissions [here](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and save it**

---

## 3) Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gensyn-ai/rl-swarm/
cd rl-swarm
```

---

## 4) Run the swarm
Open a screen to run it in background
```bash
screen -S swarm
```
Install swarm
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
./run_rl_swarm.sh
```
Press `Y`

---

## 5) Login
**1- You have to receive `Waiting for userData.json to be created...` in logs**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/140f7d32-844f-4cf0-aac4-a91e9a14c1aa)

**2- Open login page in browser**
* **Local PC:** `http://localhost:3000/`
* **VPS users:** Do not receive OTP code in emails by logging in 3000 port on browser. You have to forward port by entering a command in their local pc powershell command prompt. (Step 3 of this section)

**3- ⚠️ If you can't login or no email code received, Forward port:**
* In windows start menu, Search **Powershell** and open its terminal in your local PC
* Enter the command below and replace your vps ip with `Server_IP` and your vps port(.eg 22) with `SSH_PORT`
```
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 root@Server_IP -p SSH_PORT
```
* ⚠️ Make sure you enter the command in your own local Windows Powershell cmd and NOT your VPS terminal.
* This prompts you to enter your VPS password, when you enter it, you connect and tunnel to your vps
* Now go to browser and open `http://localhost:3000/` and login

**4- Login with your preferred method**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f33ea530-b15f-4af7-a317-93acd8618a9f)

* After login, your terminal starts installation.

**5- Optional: Push models to huggingface**
* Enter your `HuggingFace` access token you've created when it prompted
* This will need `2GB` upload bandwidth for each model you train, you can pass it by entering `N`

### Node Name
* Now your node started running, Find your name after word `Hello`, like mine is `whistling hulking armadillo` as in the image below (You can use `CTRL+SHIFT+F` to search Hello in terminal)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1abdb1a-aa11-407f-8e5b-abe7d0a6b0f3)

---

### Screen commands
* Minimize: `CTRL` + `A` + `D`
* Return: `screen -r swarm`
* Stop and Kill: `screen -XS swarm quit`

---

## Backup
**You need to backup `swarm.pem`**.
### `VPS`:
Connect your VPS using `Mobaxterm` client to be able to move files to your local system. Back up these files:**
* `/root/rl-swarm/swarm.pem`

### `WSL`:
Search `\\wsl.localhost` in your ***Windows Explorer*** to see your Ubuntu directory. Your main directories are as follows:
* If installed via a username: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\<your_username>`
* If installed via root: `\\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\root`
* Look for `rl-swarm/swarm.pem`

### `GPU servers (.eg, Hyperbolic)`:
**1- Connect to your GPU server by entering this command in `Windows PowerShell` terminal**
```
sftp -P PORT ubuntu@xxxx.hyperbolic.xyz
```
* Replace `ubuntu@xxxx.hyperbolic.xyz` with your given GPU hostname
* Replace `PORT` with your server port (in your server ssh connection command)
* `ubuntu` is the user of my hyperbolic gpu, it can be ***anything else*** or it's `root` if you test it out for `vps`

Once connected, you’ll see the SFTP prompt:
```
sftp>
```

**2- Navigate to the Directory Containing the Files**
 * After connecting, you’ll start in your home directory on the server. Use the `cd` command to move to the directory of your files:
 ```
 cd /home/ubuntu/rl-swarm
 ```

**3- Download Files**
 * Use the `get` command to download the files to your `local system`. They’ll save to your current local directory unless you specify otherwise:
 ```
 get swarm.pem
 ```
* Downloaded file is in the main directory of your `Powershell` or `WSL` where you entered the sFTP command.
  * If entered sftp command in `Porwershell`, the `swarm.pem` file might be in `C:\Users\<pc-username>`.
* You can now type `exit` to close connection. The files are in the main directory of your `Powershell` or `WSL` where you entered the first SFTP command.

---

### Recovering Backup file (upload)
If you need to upload files from your `local machine` to the `server`.
* `WSL` & `VPS`: Drag & Drop option.

**`GPU servers (.eg, Hyperbolic)`:**

1- Connect to your GPU server using sFTP

2- Upload Files Using the `put` Command:

In SFTP, the put command uploads files from your local machine to the server. 
```bash
put swarm.pem /home/ubuntu/rl-swarm/swarm.pem
```

# Run on Hyperbolic GPUs
* To install the node on **Hyperbolic** check this [Guide: Rent & Connect to GPU](https://github.com/0xmoei/Hyperbolic-GPU)
* Add this flag: `-L 3000:localhost:3000` in front of your Hyperbolic's `SSH-command`, this will allow you to access to login page via local system.

* 3- Paste SSH public key to `Setting > SSH Keys` [here](https://cloud.vast.ai/account/)
* 4- Select Pytorch(Vast) template [here](https://cloud.vast.ai/templates/)
* 5- Choose a supported GPU (I recommend >=24GB Per-GPU vRAM)
* 6- Increase `Disk Space` slidebar to `200GB`
* 7- Top-up with credits and rent it.
* 8- Go to [instances](https://cloud.vast.ai/instances/), refresh the page, click on `key` button
* 9- Create an ssh key,
* 10- Copy SSH Command, and Replace `-L 3000:localhost:3000` in front of the command.
* 11- Enter the command in `Windows Powershell` and run it

# Troubleshooting:

### ⚠️ Upgrade viem & Node version in Login Page
1- Modify: `package.json`
```bash
cd rl-swarm
nano modal-login/package.json
```
* Update: `"viem":` to `"2.25.0"`

2- Upgrade
```bash
cd rl-swarm
cd modal-login
yarn install

yarn upgrade && yarn add next@latest && yarn add viem@latest

cd ..
```

### ⚠️ CPU-only Users: Ran out of input
Navigate:
```
cd rl-swarm
```
Edit:
```
nano hivemind_exp/configs/mac/grpo-qwen-2.5-0.5b-deepseek-r1.yaml
```
* Lower `max_steps` to `5`
